TODO: 
- Rumours:
    - X (object, person, artefact, treasure) has been sigthed in Y (dungeon, lair, etc.)
    - Find rumours system generator online (or just a rumour generator)

        HOW TO
            1) Feature: Make a list of 20 features (location, faction, magic item, npc, setting details, factions, etc.)
            2) Type: Assign to each feature a type based on what it is: 
                - Danger (warning)
                - Reward (drawn towards)
                - Mystery (drawn towards)
                - Opportunity (drawn towards)
                - Challenge warning)
            It doesn't have to be 'about' the player (NPC danger could be that he's a danger to others, to the party, that HE's in danger, etc.)
            3) Object: Something that affect the feature
            4) Details: Write in some words the details of the rumour

- Go through the OSE books (basic, advanced, DM, etc.) to steal, adjust, add, correct
- https://rolesrules.blogspot.com/2013/02/almost-encounters-sights-sounds-and.html
- Repasser toutes mes sheets, mes D&D links, etc. pour être sur j'ai rien oublié

    https://drive.google.com/file/d/13fualfLEV_VaahBTaZtRggEUVtWIQXoc/view
- NPC generator: add keyword (cynical, brave, fearful, etc.)
- Check scenarios in MESBG, battle companies and gondor at war for more ideas on hexes, encounters, events, etc. 
- Relisten to all universal history podcast episode and recheck all summary of LOS podcast episode (relisten to some if needed) on Apple Podcast (summary are there) and adjust my lore accordingly
- If I want to go full solo, the best for mapping would be to make a deck of cards using threee "level" of geomorphs. 
    First one is "always have an exit to another room". 
    Second is "mostly have exits, rarely don't, sometimes they are secret", 
    the third is "almost always doesn't have an exit.". 
    That whay, you pick (for example) 10 cards of each, shuffled BY LEVEL and stack them to start with level 1. 
    you need to make sure you have at LEAST one card to go down that you shuffle at random through the three levels.
    to make sure you don't know which is which, maybe just mix them with unique rooms and so on. 
    On the side, you just need another deck of randomly assigned room description
    And then you roll to see the content as per normal room generation
- Create "temple factions" aka the various organisations obeying god-kings and watchers. 
- create lesser shrines that are set-up to honor saints, heroes, etc. have them be based on old testament figures but with a different name. for example "The Three Maiden who Withstood the Flames" (to represent the three teenagers of Daniel). the party can only have one active shrine at any point. as long as they follow the saints oath, they have a passive bonus. they can also use an active power, but then lose the active bonus until they go back to civilization to make some sorts of sacrifice/prayer. 
    - figure generator (long list of names + title)
    - shrine description (reuse the major srhine one)
    - some 'mundane' association (aka patron saints of ...)
    - oath (strict obedience to something): never ambush and always let people surrender; always heal disease and try to prevent them; give to the poor first before yourself; etc. 
    - passive
    - active
    whenever a shrine is generated, take note of it as it is unique and cannot show up again in the campaign. 
    when it appears, make sure there is an accompanying picture showing what the saints did (some sort of icon) and a clear depiction of what is the oath/requirement of the party. 
    shrines can be desecrated and broken down. they need to be restored. new one can be constructed.

- Pursuit (p. 33 Castle in Tower)
- Recheck everything in the OSE SRD to see if I missed something
- PRIME TASK: Make a 5RD generator that scales (aka it creates a 5RD level composed of 5(ish) quarters each with their 5RD rooms for a total of 25 meaningful room + a bunch of generic room (some of them being empty))
- For quarters/overdungeon maps: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18jzyOcctDytnv4V_lZ6fCNzyh0xkEVhIzrYU4zE2pfA/edit#gid=1257933702

- Covenants
    - Covenants are the demons way of having worship. Everyone is, by default, in God's covenant. 
    - Covenants are therefore, for now, more of an NPC thing. 
    - It's possible to be a Steward-Lord, aka you are a noble, but you don't have territory because you aren't in the covenant. 
    - Entering a covenant is therefore more of a quest than anything. It requires sacrifices (animals and humans), it requires to bow to the demon, to worship him through specific acts based on the covenants, etc. Also, each demon/covenant is obsessed with one particular item (like DS covenants). 
    - Covenants therefore need the basic info that I had normally (symbol, name, etc.) but also object, level-up (you gain powers), sacrifices & rites
    - Covenants rituals/spells are: 
        - You have a passive bonus
        - You can use X number of time a spell (vancian-ish like DS1)
        - When all usage are done, you lose both active and passive

If you want to integrate any magical items, either from D&D, Dark Souls or your own imagination, it is highly suggested to thing about three mechanical factors:
Prerequisite
A upside for a downside
Mechanical niche or lore
Then, it is suggested to answer to those lore questions to integrate it properly:
What do legends say of it ?
What great deed was it part of ?
When was it created ?
Who created it ?
Why was it created ?
How was it lost by its maker or user ?

NOTES/GENERAL TODO
- Maybe put encounters per terrain type?
- Link to this place from time to time: https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/random/

- In the pre-game checklist:
    - Make sure my unique list is up to date (remove what has been used and add back new stuff) such as unique room, riddles, etc.
    - Always have one treausre map ready
    - Always have one NPC ready
    - Always have one ruin ready
    - Always have one level of the megadungeon ready
    - Always have one dungeon ready
    - Always have one very cool event ready
    - Always have a table of 2d6 rumours
    - Check the various slides of campaign creator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d-NAi8Mf1W1Q71_fxzIJoqcdXtsjIla3vAAY_5tywaM/edit#gid=1151023139
    - Have a checklist of what I want to have in terms of material:
        - Note book
        - My site
        - Owlbear rodeo
        - Discord
        - DM 1st manual
- Make the world anvil stuff
- Dungeon idea: 
    basilica cistern
- Advancement = 
    - Ember + meteorite sword = magic sword. Magic sword + gems = weapon level up. 
    - Shrine + creature parts = character level up.

- Monster
    - Add monsters from:
        - Middle Earth
        - Warhammer 1st
        - Classic D&D monsters
        cost them according to point cost. it's equal to:
        - their SP cost for a single game
        - their GP cost for a month (domain turn)
        - their average SP treasure
    - Create monster tags. Make sure that it can automatically add them to monster entry in the generator?
    - Generator unique monster type in this area: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d-NAi8Mf1W1Q71_fxzIJoqcdXtsjIla3vAAY_5tywaM/edit#gid=214513084

    - Texts to look:
        - "The Wonders of the East" (anglo saxon book)
        - Bestiary of the middle age
    - Make a "classic monster" generator with stuff like werewolf, vampire (lesser), skeleton, etc. 
    - remove the unique monsters from the random encounter chart (minotaur, medusa, etc.) and instead have one "classic unique monster" roll. we want to fight orcS, but also THE minotaur. much cooler.
