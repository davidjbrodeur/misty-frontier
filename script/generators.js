However, if you win, you may not strike the opponent. \n Lance: +1 To Wound when Charging. \n Polearms: Can fight from outside the control zone of the target as long as another character is already figthing the target. Gains +1 A for the melee roll vs mounted charging targets. \n Ancient Blade (Elven Blade): +1 to melee roll. \n Bash (Hammers, Maces, Mauls): If Duel is won by Bashing Side, both sides add D6 to Strength (Two Handed grants +1) and if the Bashing model's number is equal to or highter the opponent is knocked Prone. \n Feint (Daggers & Swords): Fight value is reduced by D3, if Feinting side wins, re-roll Wound rolls of 1. Requires equal to or higher F value that the target. \n Piercing Strike (Axes and Picks): If side wins increase Str by D3, but if loses subtract D3 from Defense. \n Whirl (Flails, Scourges, and Whips) - Reduce Fight value by 1 and if melee roll is won, make a single strike against every model in fight.",

        5: "DEMONIC ITEM RULES: The item initially feels evil. You can still use it, but you'll have 1 Corruption Point (CP) and you'll be a bit more of one of the sin.  At the next adventure, during sleep, the demon will speak to the user and give him a new power in exchange for more CP/sin/'a small token of sacrifice' that seals the sin (ex: greed = steal something, anger = completely destroy a creature, etc.). Then it will do so again 1 month later and 3 month later. After that, look for an opportune moment for the 5th and final CP and then it will try to get away. Cannot be destroyed through normal means. Tries to get away naturally from its user after it corrupted it to corrupt something else. When the item is discarded/the user attempts to destroy it, it reverts back into a creature based on the object iself. Then, when the creature dies, it reverts back into the object. (The reverse can be true to generate monsters that drops a loot). Getting higher in dark corruption makes you bigger physically (you grow in height).",

/* 

Other monsters idea:
- Alukah ('horse-leech', huge leech/tiq monsters)

Add a "SPECIAL REACTION" to some monsters. That is, if confronted with X, they will do Y. This is made to showcase the lore of the game with real mechanics. For example, a certain type of golems made with Z could react by breaking down if confronted by X, to showcase its origin etc.

Boss idea = 
    the red cape monster from Conan the Destroyer (aka a monster that you can't kill directly but you need to break other objects that represents its W)

TODO: 
- Rumour generator: who (merchant, soldier, hunter, etc.) heard (what) around (where). 
- Add to random encounter the local "special" blacksmith, a clearing shrine that can heal curses and disease, etc.
- Add a 'side job' generator with retrieving artefacts from ruins, saving people, killing creatures, etc. All have them give good treasure, info, influence or hints/secrets
- Add to random encounter that you can spot old towers and high hills to get a good look at the terrain all around. Shift weather effects maybe to weather itself. Try to minimize at best as I can the resource management aspect of hexcrawling to make it more about DISCOVERY than TRAVEL.
- Add in discovering roads in the "finding secrets" of the hex. 
- IF I do hexcrawl, I should have a "players map" that represents what the player can actually 'see' on an hex grid (so full of empty hexes but at least some good points), a "fictional map" aka a drawned map, and a DM's map with hexes and locations
- Maybe do a hex map where the first level of hexes represents element within an hex and the second level are my hexes, and the third level is the regional hex (aka granularity in visual representation)
- Add to random encounter that you can meet with an old ally needing help for something
- Add to encounters caravans


Add range to range weapons

REDO:
- Hexploration
    One hex per day (+- 24 km)
        Long diagonal is 24 km
        Radius is 12 km to point
        Radius is 10 km to line (apothem)
        Sides are 12 km
    Each hex biome type has a different % for: finding secrets, getting lost, encounters, getting slowed, etc.
    E.g.
        Plains: easy to find secrets, easy to encounter, difficult to get lost or slowed, etc.
    Make a list of generic minor landmark or finding in cases a 'empty hex' (hex without a major feature) turns up a "find secret success"
    Most if not all hexes should have something: lairs, villages, landmark, vantage points, ruins, shortcuts, etc.
    Shortcuts (roads, river, passage) enables free travel on the hex where you can skip most result (except encounters)
    Shortcut encounters 9basically road encounters) should be specific and not dependant on he xbiome type

- PRIME TASK: Make a 5RD generator that scales (aka it creates a 5RD level composed of 5(ish) quarters each with their 5RD rooms for a total of 25 meaningful room + a bunch of generic room (some of them being empty))
- For quarters/overdungeon maps: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18jzyOcctDytnv4V_lZ6fCNzyh0xkEVhIzrYU4zE2pfA/edit#gid=1257933702
- Extra stuff for kingdoms: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/kingdom-building

- Faire un truc pour chaque table avec sa règle associée afin d'avoir une "cheatsheet" d'inclus dans le generator. aussi juste mettre les règles de DM
    - Pursuit (p. 33 Castle in Tower)

- Covenants ("temple factions" aka the various organisations obeying god-kings and watchers)
    - Covenants are the demons way of having worship. Everyone is, by default, in God's covenant. 
    - Covenants are therefore, for now, more of an NPC thing. 
    - It's possible to be a Steward-Lord, aka you are a noble, but you don't have territory because you aren't in the covenant. 
    - Entering a covenant is therefore more of a quest than anything. It requires sacrifices (animals and humans), it requires to bow to the demon, to worship him through specific acts based on the covenants, etc. Also, each demon/covenant is obsessed with one particular item (like DS covenants). 
    - Covenants therefore need the basic info that I had normally (symbol, name, etc.) but also object, level-up (you gain powers), sacrifices & rites
    - Covenants rituals/spells are: 
        - You have a passive bonus
        - You can use X number of time a spell (vancian-ish like DS1)
        - When all usage are done, you lose both active and passive
    
- Covenant/faction generator
    What kind of 'god' (dragon, balrog, spirit, etc.)

        Offering type
        What secret information people knows from the outset, and what secret informations they will never know
        Officiality
        (powers?)

- Add to my DM stuff disease and curse descriptions https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ET8DTWlVJNWyjvRDrp_uvp8P25QUOQi5QbYnWOvIS4o/edit#gid=50706048
- Put to DM stuff the progression and other hidden stuff (magic sword, etc.) https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JtIkJGe9YL0AwlxDpvmgOSQ9aWknJt2ShZAykJgjfCA/edit#slide=id.g13638b89f05_0_0

- Make the world anvil stuff
- Dungeon idea: 
    basilica cistern
- Advancement = 
    - Ember + meteorite sword = magic sword. Magic sword + gems = weapon level up. 
    - Shrine + creature parts = character level up. 


In this village, a [NPC] is resting for now before [action]
In this village, the local authority, a [NPC], is holding a criminal, [NPC], in their cells. This last one claims innocence. 
You meet [monster] in [location] near the village, performing [action]. However, [NPC] is watching over it [oddities]
In this village, the people are riled up about [subject/event] because [NPC] did [action]
We haven't heard of [NPC] for a time now. He lives in [location] and had an important role in the village as a [role]. 

- If I want to go full solo, the best for mapping would be to make a deck of cards using threee "level" of geomorphs. 
    First one is "always have an exit to another room". 
    Second is "mostly have exits, rarely don't, sometimes they are secret", 
    the third is "almost always doesn't have an exit.". 
    That whay, you pick (for example) 10 cards of each, shuffled BY LEVEL and stack them to start with level 1. 
    you need to make sure you have at LEAST one card to go down that you shuffle at random through the three levels.
    to make sure you don't know which is which, maybe just mix them with unique rooms and so on. 
    On the side, you just need another deck of randomly assigned room description
    And then you roll to see the content as per normal room generation

Various magic item ideas:
Banner ideas = reroll wounds, to hit, etc. based on conditions (such as 1s only, against particular monsters, etc.)

Every time a friendly Arnor model within 6" of Mal beth suffers a Wound,
roll a 06. On a 5+, the Wound has been prevented, exactly as if a point of
Fate had been expended. Note that if this roll is failed, Hero models may
still use Fate points as normal.

Always being on the effect of a spell

"Horse lord"

terror

causing wounds regain Mi/Fa/Wi

smoke bomb: S1 attack; when hit, either you spend a Wi or you are "Transfix"
