# Misty Frontier Ruleset

## What

A website to gather information on an old school RPG campaign based on the West Marches principle, old Warhammer Fantasy and Middle-Earth Battle Companies.

## Why

This is for a closed circle of people and hence why it is in french, our native language. It's meant to put all player rules easily accessible.

## How

HTML and CSS website with few JS (JQuery).

## TODO

- Pages (do them like this: https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page):
  (also need to make "templates" as I go, and just load them with jquery. like stats sheet, etc.
  all put my data in a huge json object that i'll put in an empty "data.js" where I'll only have "data = {json}")
  - Character rules
  - Equipement rules
